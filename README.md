# Election Audit Analysis
The goal of this analysis is to examine stock performance in the years 2017 and 2018, as well as to measure the efficiency of refactored code compared to the original script created through the module. 

### Results
*A total of 369,761 votes were cast in this congressional election
*The vote breakdown by county is as follows:
	*Denver County 82.8% (306,055)
	*Jefferson County 10.5% (38,855)
	*Arapahoe 6.7% (24,801)
	*Denver had the largest county turnout, accounting for 66% more of the votes cast than the other two counties audited.

## Proposal for Future Use

This script can be used for future audits to confirm the vote count per candidate and assure correct counts in all elections. 
Additionally, the script might be modified to audit additional counties and to calculate both candidate votes and voter turnout. 
The script can help the election commission to detect any inconsistensies in number of votes cast compared to voter registration roles, and to detect error or fraud in any county's election system. 
It can also help determine areas where voter registration efforts or additional polling places may be called for, due to very high or low voter turnout. 
The advantage of the script is that with minor modifications, it can be used for any election and be made to include any coutnies in the state.
